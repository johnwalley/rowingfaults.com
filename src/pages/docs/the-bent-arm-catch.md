title: The bent arm catch
description: Arms bent at the moment the blade enters the water.
---

## Symptom

Arms bent at the moment the blade enters the water.

---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Applying too much pressure with the arms at the catch.

### Solution

Relax the grip of the hands on the blade. The hands should be hooked around the blade, and when the legs drive at the catch the hands should feel as though they are momentarily left behind, this keeping the arms extended, feeling a pull through the shoulders.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Sliding forward on the recovery with bent arms.

### Solution

Stretch off backstops with straight arms, and maintain this position. Do not allow a lack of slide control to let your seat overtake yourhands! Remember, 'Hands, body, slide.'
