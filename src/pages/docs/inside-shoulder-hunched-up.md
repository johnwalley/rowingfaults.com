## Symptom

Inside shoulder held high next to the earlobe and never relaxed during the stroke.

---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Pulling too hard with the inside arm, common in people changing sides.

### Solution

Establish that the inside hand controls feathering and squaring, and the outside hand draws the blade. Emphasized by the exercises: a. Paddling with the outside hand off the blade, b. Paddling with the inside hand down the loom.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Hands too close together.

### Solution

Check the position of the hands â€” they should be a minimum of two hands widths apart, but no more than shoulder width apart. A good method of establishing the correct position of the hands us to row with the outside hand off allowing the inside hands to find a position of comfortable draw, then replacing the outside hand close to the end of the oar handle.

## Cause and solution #3

### Cause

Grip of the inside hand too far over the oar handle.

### Solution

Check the position of the grip, wrists and arms in a straight line during the draw.
