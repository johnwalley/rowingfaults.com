## Symptom

As the blade approaches the catch, instead of being lowered to just above the waterline, it is lifted away from the waterline.

---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Pushing the hands down towards the toes just before the catch.

### Solution

Allow the hands to rise just before the catch. You should feel as though you could stand up on the stretcher as you begin to apply the pressure at the catch. To do this the upper body needs to be rasied over the knees.

---

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Too much height of the work.

### Solution

Check the height of the work.

---

## Cause and solution #3

### Cause

Over reaching at the catch.

### Solution

Practise body-position exercises, and mark with straws the 'body-over' position from backstops. Once this position is reached following the finish, the body position should be held through to the catch.

---

## Cause and solution #4

### Cause

Blade being held too close to the water during the recovery, and therefore raised just before the catch to provide room to square without clipping the water.

### Solution

Practise square-blade paddling and blade-control exercises.
