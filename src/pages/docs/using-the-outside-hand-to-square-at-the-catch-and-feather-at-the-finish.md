title: Using the outside hand to square at the catch and feather at the finish

## Symptom

The wrist of the outside arm instead of remaining flat through the stroke is rasised above the oar handle at the catch and dropped below the oar handle at the finish.

---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Gripping the oar handle too tightly especially with the outside hand. This prevents the oar handle being rotated within the outside hand by the inside hand.

### Solution

Ensure that the inside hand is responsible for the squaring/feathering the blade at both the catch and the finish. Useful exercises to practise this are: a. Outside hand off. b. Inside hand down the loom.
