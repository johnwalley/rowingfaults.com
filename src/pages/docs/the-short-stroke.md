## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Stretcher positioned too close to the line of work, or the rake of the stretcher is too steep.

### Solution

Check the stretcher position.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Not allowing the body to follow the arc of the blade around the rigger at the catch and the finish.

### Solution

Ensure that the shoulders remain parallel to the blade throughout the stroke, twisting through the lower ribcage.
