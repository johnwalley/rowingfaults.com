## Symptom

Driving the seat towards backstops before the spoon of the blade has entered the water at the catch.

---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

The legs being driven faster than the speed at which the blade is being pulled by the hands.

### Solution

The hands and legs need to have a co-ordinated action. The speed at which the seat travels needs to match that at whic the blade is travelling. To help correct this fault try to pull the blade through the shins on the drive.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Stretching for too much forward length, which places the back in a weak position.

### Solution

Establish position of body over from backstops and mark on the saxboards with a straw, always swing over to this point on all strokes and no further.

## Cause and solution #3

### Cause

Commencing the leg drive before the blade has entered the water.

### Solution

Speed up the blade entry at the catch. Useful exercises include backstop paddling, 1/2 slide paddling and frontstop paddling.

## Cause and solution #4

### Cause

Trunk not strong enough to hold firm during the leg drive.

### Solution

Strengthen the back and stomach muscles by leg raises lying face down, dorsal raises to the horizontal lying over the side of a table with the legs held firm and abdominal crunches.
