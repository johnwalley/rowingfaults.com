## Symptom

At the finish the shoulders and head are held above or in front of the oar handle instead of behind it, and the body has not passed back through the vertical but is held at the vertical or slightly hunched forward.---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Not maintaining the pressure on the stretcher on the later part of the stroke.

### Solution

Do not allow the feet to lose their grip on the stretcher during the stroke, especially the last third of the stroke.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Failure to use the power of the shoulders at the finish.

### Solution

Ensure that the outside shoulder is being drawn around the rigger parallel to the oar handle and that the shoulders are opened out at the finish. Imagine that you are trying to get your shoulder blades to touch each other as you approach the finish. Practise the draw while paddling with the inside arm down the loom.

## Cause and solution #3

### Cause

Using the amrs to pull to early during the stroke.

### Solution

The arms should act as tight ropes linking the oar handle to the trunk until the bodyt has reached at least the vertical. Once the body is at the vertical the arm draw should commence. With the arm draw the elbows begin to bend.
