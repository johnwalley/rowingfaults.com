---

## Cause and solution #1

### Cause

Not enough positive pitch.

### Solution

Check the pitch.

## Cause and solution #2

### Cause

Blade not fully squared at the catch.

### Solution

Practise entering the water at the catch with the blade fully sqaured, using square-blade paddling. Check grip of hands on the oar handle.

## Cause and solution #3

### Cause

Lifting up excessively with the arms and shoulders at the catch.

### Solution

Ensure that the catch is not taken by the upper body alone, this often occurs if there is a tendency ro drop over the feet at the catch, not raising the arms up in line with the shoulders. The draw of the upper body is essentially horizontal not vertical. Practise these points using frontstops paddling.
